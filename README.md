# Movie Search App
A simple and responsive web application that allows users to search for movies and view key details such as the movie title, release year,genre, poster and IMDb rating using the OMDb API.
The app retrieves real-time data from an external movie database API and displays results dynamically without reloading the page.
 
## Features
- Search movies by title
- Display movie poster and details
- Real-time data fetching using an external API
- Dynamic content rendering without page refresh
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Error handling for invalid searches
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used
- HTML - Application structure
- CSS - Styling and layout
- JavaScript - Application logic and API integration

## How the App Works
- The user enters a movie title in the search field
- JavaScript sends a request to a movie database API
- The API responds with movie data in JSON format
- The app processes the data and extracts relevant details
- The results are displayed dynamically on the user interface

This app requires an API key from a movie database service.

Steps:

- Sign up on a movie database platform (e.g., OMDb API)
- Generate your API key
- Open the JavaScript file
- Replace the placeholder with your API key: const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
